**1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?**

   Our independent variable is the congruent or incongruent word that 
   is printed and our dependent variable is the amount of time taken by the participants to name the ink colors.

**2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.**


**3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. 
   Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.**

   | Statistics      | Congruent     | Incongruent  | Overall   |
   | --------------- |:-------------:| ------------:| ---------:|
   | Mean            | 14.05         | 22.01        | 18.03     |
   | Median          | 14.35         | 21.01        | 17.73     |
   | Pop. Variance   | 12.14         | 22.05        | 32.95     |
   | Pop. Std. Dev.  | 3.48          | 4.69         | 5.74      |
   | Sample Variance | 12.66         | 23.01        | 33.65     |
   | Sample Std. Dev.| 3.55          | 4.79         | 5.80      |
   
**4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. 
   Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.**
   
   
**5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? 
   Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. 
   Did the results match up with your expectations?**
