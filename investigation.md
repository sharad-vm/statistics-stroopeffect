**1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?**

   Our independent variable is the congruent or incongruent word that 
   is printed and our dependent variable is the amount of time taken by the participants to name the ink colors.

**2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? 
   Justify your choices.**
   
   As Null hypothesis states that there is no relationship or nothing changes between two measured phenomena, the appropriate null 
   hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) in this task is that there is no difference in time taken to identify the coor of the words in either 
   congruent or incongruent conditions. 
   
   And the appropriate alternate hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>) is that the incongruent word condition would take longer than the congruent 
   word condition. 
   
   H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>i</sub> = μ<sub>c</sub> (μ<sub>i</sub> - population mean of incongruent values, μ<sub>c</sub> - population mean 
   of congruent values) 
   
   H<sub>A</sub>: μ<sub>i</sub> > μ<sub>c</sub> (μ<sub>i</sub> - population mean of incongruent values, μ<sub>c</sub> - population mean 
   of congruent values)
   
   In other words, if the difference in means of incongruent and congruent word conditions is equal to 0, it means the time taken to say 
   the color out loud in both the conditions is the same and that the null hypothesis is true else, if the difference is greater than 0 
   then it means that the time taken in the incongruent condition is more than the tome taken in the congruent condition and that the 
   alternate hypothesis is true.

**3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. 
   Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.**

   | Statistics      | Congruent     | Incongruent  | Overall   |
   | --------------- |:-------------:| ------------:| ---------:|
   | Mean            | 14.05         | 22.01        | 18.03     |
   | Median          | 14.35         | 21.01        | 17.73     |
   | Pop. Variance   | 12.14         | 22.05        | 32.95     |
   | Pop. Std. Dev.  | 3.48          | 4.69         | 5.74      |
   | Sample Variance | 12.66         | 23.01        | 33.65     |
   | Sample Std. Dev.| 3.55          | 4.79         | 5.80      |
   
**4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. 
   Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.**
   
   
**5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? 
   Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. 
   Did the results match up with your expectations?**
